      four general seasons occurring on Earth - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Flowers and
      seasons are intimately bound to each other. When Most of the flowers are season-specific.
      However, some flowers are found throughout the year, not particularly affected by changing
      seasons.</p>
